**When you mean well but you're still in jail**

That work you did for your neighbor for free, that trash you picked up in front of your library, the homeless man you give money to every day on the way to work, don't matter to the judge handeling the your case for backing over your neighbors kid unless you can present them as visual evidance. But you were to worried about helping these people to collect any vain photos of you doing good, the same way you were to hurried on your way to work when the neighbors kid walked behiend your car. But now you're in jail, and you always meant well, why is that?

Your nehibors atorrney argued you were upset at your nehibor for not paying you, while you could have cared less, you saw a man in need and you helped. Your defense offered to say the nehibors child was trespassing, but you said that would be to mean... and now you're in jail.

When you can listen, and react

Hillary's public opionin and private opinion

When you can't listen, or react

Remember when your nehibor kicked your dog?

**Was the nehibor a person?** He kicked your dog to get him off his 3 year old who was being bit.

**Was the dog a bad person?** He was starved to the point of death and your nehibors toddler has been screaming for weeks.

**Were you the bad person?**You haven't seen your pit bull in five days because you dropped everything and raced to to your wife when she ran off the road in a life altering car crash, a state over. When she called you delirous and bleeding before passing out on the phone, and your quick reaction to drive to where you thought she was, you genuinely believe saved her life

Who knows, who cares.
All the dog knows is it was kicked.
All the Nehibor knows is his son was attacked.
And when you came back the state had already put your dog down.
