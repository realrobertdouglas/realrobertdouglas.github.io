I used to write long essays. One time I even wrote a book. Fewer than 1,000 people read them. I would use them to explain concepts and would point readers there as an expanded resource when the internet lacked appropriate depth of some ideas. While I'm sure for moments I was a PHD in my mind, at any time I was more similar to a PDF, a file instance usually read or used just once.

I also used to write articles under pseudonyms. Fewer than 10,000 people read those, as they were often written for a niche culture, aiming to push innovation in what I believed was an underdeveloped sector. Unit combat tactics, decompression theorems, and business strategy were tools that those who could benefit most often lacked time to study, were risky if misapplied, or were too unique to be left to public speculation.

Now, I write short essaysâ€”where you get to fill in the blanks, but I still get to share an idea with the few I believe will advance as a result.

I hope you can draw some aphorisms from my adventures.
