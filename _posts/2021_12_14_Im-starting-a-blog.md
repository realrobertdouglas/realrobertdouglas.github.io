I used to write essays. One time I even wrote a book. Fewer than 1,000 people read them, because I used them primarily to explain concepts and would point readers there as an expanded resource when the internet lacked appropriate translation of some ideas. While I'm sure

I also used to write articles under pseudonyms—fewer than 10,000 people read those, as they were often written for a niche culture, aiming to push innovation in what I believed was an underdeveloped sector. Unit combat tactics, decompression theorems, and business strategy were tools that those who could benefit most often lacked time to study, were risky if misapplied, or were too interesting to be left to public speculation.

Now, I write short essays—where you get to fill in the blanks, but I still get to share an idea with the few I believe will advance as a result.

I hope you can draw some aphorisms from my adventures.
