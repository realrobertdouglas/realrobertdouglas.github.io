NOTOX

We don’t fail randomly, we fail when the past or future catches up to us.

In technical scuba diving, your success depends on more than how deep you go. It depends on how well you transition. You don’t just bring one tank and hope it lasts. You bring stage tanks for specific depths. You bring transfer gas to safely move between depths. And you bring deco gas to get you home.

It’s a system. A strategy. A philosophy.

But more important than carrying the right tanks is knowing how to switch between them.

That’s where NOTOX comes in—a critical protocol for switching to a stage cylinder underwater:

N - Note your name and the maximum depth (MOD) on the cylinder label.
O - Observe your actual depth and compare it to the MOD.
T - Turn on the valve. Check cylinder pressure.
O - Orient the second stage—pull it from the retaining bands.
X - eXamine your teammates—follow the hose from their mouth to the stage bottle.

Every step exists to reduce risk in high-stakes transitions. Every action is intentional. Nothing is rushed.

And if you zoom out, NOTOX is life.

You’re switching projects? Switching mindsets? Switching relationships?
	•	Note where you are. Know your identity and what the current phase requires.
	•	Observe your environment. Is this a safe place to make the change?
	•	Turn on the system. Prep your tools, resources, mindset.
	•	Orient your direction. Know where your next breath—your next move—is coming from.
	•	eXamine your support network. Who’s with you? Are you aligned? Is your team breathing from the right tanks?

When people crash in life, it’s often during transitions. They didn’t check their depth. They didn’t prep their gear. They didn’t realize the pressure they were under—or worse, the pressure their teammates were under.

Technical diving teaches you to respect the switch.
Because the switch is where people fail—or survive.

Want to live deeply? Want to grow?

Bring the right tanks. Make your transitions clean.
This is where the growth is.
