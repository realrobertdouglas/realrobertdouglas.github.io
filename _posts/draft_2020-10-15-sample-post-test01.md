in America, it is legal to perform a citizens arrest on anyone , including politicians and police. you just call the right :"Authority" to make it official. then present yourself as a witness in court - A citizen's arrest is an arrest made by a private citizen â€“ that is, a person who is not acting as a sworn law-enforcement official. In common law jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval England and the English common law, in which sheriffs encouraged ordinary citizens to help apprehend law breakers.
