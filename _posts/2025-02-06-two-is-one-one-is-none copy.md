Negligence doesn’t always come with a bang. Sometimes it slips in quietly—disguised as comfort, routine, or too many days without pain. Whether it’s a firearm, a vehicle, a business decision, or a moment of passion, a discharge at the wrong time, in the wrong place, without awareness has the same root cause: we stopped respecting what we were holding.

When nothing goes wrong for a while, we feel invincible. The gun hasn’t malfunctioned. The startup’s still running. The argument didn’t explode. But the absence of pain breeds overconfidence. We stop noticing the edge on the blade.

And that’s when things go sideways.

Experience doesn’t make you reckless- it makes you reverent. In warfare, the most seasoned operators are the quietest, the most cautious. They don’t rush because they’ve seen what rushing costs. They double-check safeties, measure their steps, and move like every inch matters— because experience says it does.

I’ve had negligent discharges. But each time, the gun was pointed at a safe backstop. That didn’t erase the mistake, but it erased the tragedy. When my regulator failed at 90 feet, I reached calmly for the spare. It wasn’t skill—it was backup. Two layers of protection drop the risk from fatal to survivable.

I carry that same mindset into conversations— especially the risky ones. When I know the other person might walk away, I anchor something safe into the exchange. A common goal. A shared memory. A statement like: “No matter what we decide, I still respect you.”

That anchor gives us both something to hold on to if the current pulls hard.

Because that’s what the environment for sharp tools demands: not just skill, but safeguards. Not just intention, but backup.

A scalpel, a sailboat, a spreadsheet, a startup, or a sentence in a tense conversation—each can do damage if mishandled. The more power something holds, the more care it requires.

Sure, the first time something “just goes off,” it might be funny. But seasoned people know: luck isn’t a strategy. Redundancy is. Respect is.

The sharper the sword, the deeper the scar. But if you’ve layered your safety right, the scar stays small and the lesson stays big.

p.s. if you ever put two or three layers of funny into a joke, the joke is way better
