# Get your life together.

If Robert Douglas sent you here, start at **'(1) [Tools](link-to-part-of-page.link)'** , if not, recommended reading begins immediately:

# (iv) No one cares what you think, the only thing that matters is what you do.
No one cares how you feel, no one cares what you thought, the people around you and your life will only be defined by your actions.

The words the last person person said to you; those words represent their attempt to communicate an idea to you, it was **what they wanted you to hear**. All language is mind control.

Your actions, can be pointed to as fact. They leave a measurable change on your environment, and are the only long standing proof of **who you are**.

I won't lie; people often remember how you made them feel more than they remember the words you said, and sadly people when introduced to something too far outside their frame are more likely to interpret it incorrect than they are to ignore it.

So think frequently, it's free! Be careful in your words, and make your action now for future you, because every day you wake up is determined by the actions you took yesterday, so if you want to have a better life for you and the people around you it starts now.

# (iii) How 'Current You' you makes decisions, and how you can set 'Future You' up for success:

Every time you do something successful three criteria are usually met. A (1) *prompt* that lead you to that action took place, an (2) *understanding* of how to complete the action was avilable to you (allowing your mind to process the outcome as possible), and you had the (3) *energy* (likely in the emotional form of *motovation*) to do it.

This means if you want *future you* to accomplish the goals *present you* currently desires... you'll need to plan for every action in the future to have the right:

(1) Prompt, ususally in the form of a scheduled or well placed **reminder** you'll come across again. They tend to work best when they reveal themselves at the most approprate time to initiate the task you've planned...

(2) Understanding, of the steps required to start or complete the task, often in the form of **notes** that accompany a prompt OR internalised so that you can enter the task with as little thinking as possible... and

(3) Energy, for you to conquer the hurdle of starting (knowing your potential for a positive outcome is more valuable than the energy risk you'll expend attempting it) and that benifit of future reasources or time will give you back more energy than the task took from you.

# (ii) This is too much, I'm overwhelmed, I don't have the energy, and I can't make time

If you lack a *prompt*, you won't do the task at the right time, and it'll be as though you have to make the new *prompt* all over again with no garuntee it'll be done. If you lack the *understanding*, your task will feel overwelming and impossible because it is currently impossible in your minds eye, only more information through research or trial and error will change this. If you lack the *energy* your body is likely being rational, it may see the task as more energy than reward you'll get back. Maybe you've already had a long day, maybe the idea of taking another thing on feels uncomfortable. Humans tend to work best in short bursts, where there is clear recovery and motivation available.

**Overwelmed?** Record your items in a list. You know you won't do them all now. Have a smart phone? Use the native reminders app and you can re-sort by priority. Found those that are most important? Do them in that order. When you're overwelmed only **focus** will set you free.

**Don't have the energy?** Good. It means you worked hard so you can rest hard. Not motovated but not tired? You didn't work hard enough, you need to work harder so you can rest harder. Is this a perpetual issue? Ask others for help, not in completing your task, but telling you what to prioritize.

**No energy but have time?** Drink a glass of water, eat a snack, walk for 8 minutes or more, and reconsider. Does your signifigant-other have the same problem, bring them a glass of water and make them drink it, feed them a snack and make them eat it, then take them on a walk. Based on your relationship this may end up solving 80% or more of problems. If this doesn't work you may benifit from a lower sugar and carbohydrate diet, a sub 15 minute nap with your feet elevated, or a little bit of [caffeine](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M1MMR3F/)

**Not enough time?**  A [pomodoro](easy-example.link) is a work-break-structure that allows consistent breaks for recovery and deferring distractions to promote a sustainable [Flow state](easyexample.link) where nothing else clouds your brain. If you can't dedicate one 25 minute block to completeing a pomadoro in the effort of getting what you wanted done, you need to re-evaluate what you do every day, and maybe wake up earlier.

**There's to much going on, I know what I need to do, why should I make a list** Your signal to noise ratio sounds terrible, I bet like a dog you’re distracted by the next tennis ball to cross your path. How can you possibly try to change your life if you can't take stock of what you're doing right now. That list may work as a motivator, as every time you cross something off your subconscious gets more dopamine than intercourse… but there's a bigger benefit. That list may work as a filter, where the tasks of the day normally keep popping up in your head and you respond “later” to them, and the list remove that… but there's a bigger benefit. That list may tell you what you can actually get done in a day, because when everything written out you see the big picture… but there's a bigger benefit. That list may make current you smarter, because space normally consumed by your brains random-access-memory (known as memory pressure in computer science and cognitive science) just got freed up… but there's a bigger benefit. When you review an old list you can see what you thought was important, and what wasn’t. This review programs your subconscious to emotionally value the actions that had a long term impact on your life over the things that faild. With out your conscious having to do work beyond reading an old list, you’re tuning your body just like any auto shop tunes a car (they measure exhaust gases btw)

# (i) I'm doing the things in front of me but my life isn't getting better.

You'll get what you want when you have [focus](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/289757)

The following tools are meant to enable you to take stock of your life, prioritize what is really important to you hobbies and work included, and move those things forward.

- You don't know to know your goals, they will come with time, and you can apply these tools on them as you need
- You don't need to do these things for more than 25 minutes (one pomadoro) a day, but if you do there is a high chance that after you're up and running you'll feel as a result that you did more for your self in one day than you've done in a week
- The clearest benefit of these is not that you'll be able to achieve your goals, but you'll be able to complete what you said you would.

When your actions match your words, your words can match your thoughts, and this will give you a consistent, not necessarily easy, straightforward path for what you set your mind to to more consistently before reality.

**I likely need you to do this so you can be reliable, so we can do more complex things, and achieve more consistent results togeather.**

To push through a task the checksums you need are:
- "Does future me benifit from this?"
- "What do my emotions allow'?"
- "At the end will I be better or worse off than I feel I am right now?"

As well the emotional programming you'll likely beinfit the most from vocalising is:
- "one more"
- "remember my goals"
- "you can do anything for a minute

# (1) Tools

This is an overview of the tools I use, and in some-cases require others use to receive a paycheck. I don't care who you are, but you can't go nearly as far with me if your actions don't match your words.

### Discipline Tools
1) [The Ivey Lee Method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee)
2) [Pomadoros](https://pomofocus.io/)
3) [The two minute rule](https://hoanhan.co/2-minute-rule)
4) Keeping my email inbox at zero.

### Organizational Tools

2) [Clean Fox](https://www.cleanfox.io/)
3) [Slidebox](http://slidebox.co/)
4) [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/)
5) Thinking about how "future me" will want to use something when I write it down.


### Communication Tools:
1) [The Nato Alphabet](some.link)
2) [5 Lines or Less Email](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/226581)
3) Adding "Please respond by ________" to my signature footer.

# (2) Tasks

This is an overview of the low level routines I use, and accept conversational or social narritive breakes of others, when they do themselves. You'll find I have no isses asking one to mute themselves to have someone do a mission critical task... even when others are on the call, exponentally increasing the number of man-minutes consumed.


- Start: The first five seconds of starting are the hardest, once you're moving it becomes monumentally easier
- Prioritize: If it takes two minutes or less, do it right now
- Organise: Do things in the priority they help you, not easiest to hardest.
- Focus: Only push things off when you have non-emotional reasoning to, things that are deferred are more taxing, and less benificial when done later.
- Remember: 20% of your actions will likely be responsible for 80% of your progress

# (3) Behaviors

It's important you increase your likelihood of doing all the things you said you would. These actions increase you're ability and motivation to do future actions:

### Prompt
- Simple enough to give you focus
- Easy for you to complete or delete
- Well placed so it can be compared to others in your current environment and taken seriously

### Understanding:
- add steps to your tasks (they'll guide you when you get bored, confused, or forgetful as all conciseness do when you get lost)
- link objects with clear titles, so you know WHY later that reasource can be useful

### Energy
- Sleep well, use tools when necessary [natural drugs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081ZFZJ5Z/) [maks to keep you asleep](https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Blindfold-Building-Adjustable-Layers/dp/B07JH2C4D5/) [ear plugs to block out noise](https://www.amazon.com/Upgraded-Earplugs-Comfortable-Sleeping-Studying/dp/B08K76W3K8/r) [mouth tape if you sleep with your mouth open](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086BY1SWR/)
- Wake up early (make the day yours, not you being controlled by the day) [use an alarm](https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Settings-Humidity-Temperature-Electric/dp/B07RKTVQDR/) [sleep next to someone?](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Fitness-Activity-Tracking-Included/dp/B084CQ41M2/) [hate yourself?] (https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Clock-Silent-Motion-Tracking/dp/B07P83FTR5/)
- Drink coffee before 12pm
- Work harder and suffer so you can recover harder

# (4) Benifits

When you make a list you're effectivly taking stock of your life. Review that list now, and you might find some of your actions were impulsive, or can be done at the same place but are current at two different times. Review that list tomorrow, and you'll feel better about accomplishing things, your conscious and subconscious will get an emotional boost. Review that list later this year and you'll be able be able to determine what actions made a difference, and your subconscious will naturally sway you in the future towards those that made the most difference.

## You'll get more done
The more you do for yourself the more you get to see rewards you generate. Didn't complete anything you wanted to today? Do five push ups, you just got stronger. Did only 1 thing today? Remove it from your list, there's one less thing in your way. Did three things today? You're going to see major change pretty quickly in your life. Did more than three things every day? you're now in the top 1% of preforming people. 

## You'll enjoy working more.
 [Flow state](easyexample.link) is achieved when the distractions on a person are limited, all of their [nutrient](mazlows-tryangle.link) needs are balanced. The process of creation comes easily as the actions they're taking are progressive and simple due to proper preparation and setting up frame. When the mind is balanced, it can move as easily in any direction, and is as free to make any decision as any other.  These are the components that YOU can effect and DRIVE the decisions that determine your outcomes in life. If you want to achieve anything, it starts by doing. Motivation isn't always available, and sometimes suffering and thinking are required to achieve goals, but like any muscle... the more you do something, the easier it gets. You'll feel the best, get the most things done, and life the longest when you have balance in your life.
