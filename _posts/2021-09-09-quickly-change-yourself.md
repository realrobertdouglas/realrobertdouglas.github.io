It's inharent to your biology to tell your self you like yourself. But tell me this... when hear a recording of your self, or look at your self in the mirror, don't you gravitate towards your flaws?

Everyones perception of themselves is inharrently different from others perceptions of them. While your own self image may be colored by your emotions, thoughts, and opinions on things you may or may not have vocalised... others have the same thoughts and opinions but place grater weight on their perception of your actions with them, your enviroment, and others, and espically what you've vocalised.

When we talk with others, the fastest way we bring about change is through getting a hard reaction. Just like touching a hot surface and getting burned. These emotional wounds fade with time; but in their aftermath we are espically sensitive not to do them again. It is during this time the most amount of change is measured, and people "wright course" to avoid future wrongs.

Emotionally this is measured as "discomfort", a time at which you are encouraged to adapt as quickly as possible to your enviroment.
