"Every organism decides their next action by comparing the expected energy expended to their possibility of potential return gained" - Some scientist, probably*

That little voice you hear as you read inside your head is **your conciseness**; it can only do one thing at a time, and is very forgetful. It is what you, and it, likely call you "you", but no one else does... thankfully. Thinking costs you nothing, and you expose noting doing it... So think often, please.

Those words the last person vocalized to you; represent their attempt to communicate an idea to you, it was **what they wanted you to hear**. Speaking is a tool not all organisms have developed but it useful for cooperation. It costs more energy than thinking, and risks social capital as soon as you've opened your mouth.

Why? The person listening has to dedicate energy to listening; so say something smart and you'll gain social value with that party, say something stupid, and you'll loose it. As long as your social value is negative with someone, they're incentivized to avoid you, while the higher you social value gets the more likely they'll give up whatever they're doing to hear you speak. Every time you open your mouth you're taking a risk and expending a little bit of energy. 

So while thinking costs virtually nothing, and speaking costs a lot more, but both pale in comparison to the energy risk an organism takes when they take action. When an organism reads, writes, or moves something they're consuming time, emotional, and physical energy. When you drive somewhere you consume fuel, depreciation on your car, and that expenditure of your personal time and energy is likely to come out to a number of dollars or likely tens of dollars, not cents. When you do physical labor you expel great amounts of energy and risk damaging yourself or the assets you're working with. When you fix something you risk making it worse before it gets better, even if it's not working currently, taking it apart makes it more difficult for someone else to fix in that new state. When an organism takes an action, it is usually the best measurement of what they're willing and able to accomplish, or **who they really are.**

Do you think a lot about engineering when you sit in class? Unless you're releasing you are releasing those creations through schematics or physical projects you're still only categorized as a student, not an engineer.

Do you dream of things you could do if your life was more organized? Unless you're going to organize your life, you're a dreamer, not a doer... and most people dream a lot.

If you take this as motivation to do something you wanted to, I'm happy for you, do it, there is a high chance it will improve your life. But know it will likely be as fleeting as your interest in reading this in the first place. If you don't know where to start, try my [get your life together](other-article.link) and don't stop until you check off all the checkboxes.

Just know your actions define you, they're the progress that allows you to move your life forward, and make measurable change unlike your thoughts or words.
