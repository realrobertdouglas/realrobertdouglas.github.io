In my last post, Efficient Transhuman Systems, I wrote about the way tools—particularly digital ones—are accelerating past human limits. They allow us to build faster, scale further, and think more clearly than ever before. But sometimes, tools don’t just extend us—they conceal our limits.

I’ve met people who use ChatGPT or similar systems to express ideas, organize thoughts, or draft communication they wouldn’t otherwise be able to articulate on their own. That’s not inherently a problem—it’s a brilliant use of leverage. But the danger appears when that tool is the only thing holding the idea together.

You can tell when this happens. The tools speak louder than the person.

Someone sends a message that sounds polished, precise, maybe even visionary. But when you reply and ask for clarification, direction, or depth—they freeze. You realize the message wasn’t from them, not really. It was from the tool they used to get further than they themselves could go. And now, they’re out of road.

I had a boss like that once. It was his first real leadership role, and he was trying his best. But he didn’t have the tools to handle the follow-through. He could write great memos. He could pitch an idea. He could send a brilliant email or strategy deck—maybe even using a tool like this one.

But the moment came when his team asked, “What next?”

And he didn’t know. Because the tool stopped working when it came to real-time judgment, hard decisions, and situational awareness. You can borrow the words, but not the wisdom. And tools don’t lead people—people do.

The lesson here isn’t that using AI or assistance is wrong. I use it. You’re reading this because I believe in it. But if you build your voice without building yourself, your leadership will collapse when you’re finally asked to lead.

Extend yourself. Don’t outsource yourself.

You have to grow into the voice you borrow. Or one day, it will leave you behind.
